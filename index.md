# Probelm #2: Lowest Delivery Cost

**Informal Description**: 
There is a wedding party that wants to have food from all 20 restaurants. But, the wedding is
in four hours and they do not have enough time or money to pick up all the food. The wedding part is hiring 
a food delivery service to go to every restaurant and pick up the food. The cost changes depending
on what order the delivery driver goes too. The wedding party is trying to find the minimal cost
to collect the food from all the restaurants. Below is the restaurant path that will give the minimal cost.

> **Formal Description**:
A Prims algorithm minimum spanning tree will be used to find the lowest cost for the delivery driver to
go to the 20 restuarant and pick up the food. The algorithm will find the lowest cost between each 
restaurant and take that path.
>  * Input:
>  * Output: A minimal spanning tree representing the path that will give the lowest cost to pick up all the food from each restaurant.
